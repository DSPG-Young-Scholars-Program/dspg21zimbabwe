## Multidimensional Poverty in Crisis: Lessons from Zimbabwe [PDF](https://doi-org.ezproxy.lib.vt.edu/10.1080/00220388.2015.1087511)

During the first decade of the twenty-first century, Zimbabwe experienced a sharp social, political, and economic crisis, but is now on a recovery path.  Since February 2009, inflation has been under control and economic growth has returned, although the recovery is still regarded as fragile. The macroeconomic causes and the economy-wide impact of the crisis have been documented (Hanke, 2012; Mashakada, 2013; Ndlela, 2011), along with the impact of land reform on the wellbeing of different household groupings (Scoones et al., 2010). However, the evolution of household wellbeing and its different dimensions during and after the crisis have not been fully investigated. It is unclear how the economic crisis and subsequent recovery impacted various dimensions of household wellbeing, such as access to education and public services, health, or income/consumption. This paper fills this gap by analysing changes in multidimensional indicators of poverty between 2001, 2007 and 2011–2012 using the nationally representative household Incomes, Consumption, and Expenditure Surveys (ICES) and Poverty, Income, Consumption, and Expenditure Survey (PICES). This paper extends the MPI analysis in several ways. First, it provides a comparative multidimensional poverty measure before, during, and after the crisis. Second, it employs ICES/PICES datasets that allow examination of more deprivation dimensions than is possible with the DHS. Inclusion of additional dimensions enables construction of an index adapted to the Zimbabwean context. Third, the multidimensional poverty measure permits adjustment of deprivation thresholds to reflect the Zimbabwean reality, including urban and rural differences in poverty dimensions. Multidimensional indices aggregate deprivations encountered by households – accounting for the number of individuals in households – to form a picture of the complex evolution of poverty from 2001 to 2011–2012.5 The index employed in this paper, based on the Alkire–Foster (A–F) method (Alkire & Foster, 2011a), is decomposed by dimension and geographic area to identify key factors affecting deprivation. Results show a clear increase in multidimensional poverty from 2001 to 2007, and then a decrease from 2007 to 2011–2012, leaving an ambiguous overall change in poverty from 2001 to 2011–2012. The results are robust to alternative specifications. Changes in individual dimensions do not always follow overall changes, highlighting different dynamics in poverty dimensions that should be considered in the design of poverty alleviation and recovery efforts. For instance, access to electricity and some human capital indicators actually improved through the 2000s. In contrast, health indicators and ownership of livestock in rural areas declined even in the recovery period, while access to services declined and then recovered.
